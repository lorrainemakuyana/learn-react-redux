# React Redux Notepad

### What is Redux 
A state management library that works with JavaScript Applications that can be used with React, Angular, Vue and possibly other frameworks e.g Vanilla JS. 
/
Redux is useful for keeping different parts of the UI in sync, to update data across UI elements. All the application's state is retrieved from the store, the single source of truth. To update data, only update data in the store and all front end element get their data from the store. It basically centralizes the applications and make data flow transparent. 
/
### Why Redux?
**Centralization of state** - the store is the single source of truth
/
**Predictable state changes** - Easily see how application state changes 
/
**Time travel debugging** - the ability to jump from one state to a previous state, essentially rendering the UI in a previous state. The entire application can be saved in a specific file and reload it later. 
/
**Log Rocket** - A tool that gives an always on Redux dev tool that allows you to load an application using the same state of the user and solve errors.
/
**Caching** - Redux helps you easily preserve page state
